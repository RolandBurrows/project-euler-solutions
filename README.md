#### Warning: this repo contains spoliers - do not investigate further unless you have attempted to solve the challenges yourself first!

From the [Project Euler mainpage](https://projecteuler.net/):

>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical / computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

In the [Project Euler archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) are the problems themselves, and each folder in this repo will contain code for determining the solutions.
